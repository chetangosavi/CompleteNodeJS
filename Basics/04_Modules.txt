Modules :
    - There is no GUI in Node js, no html or css this also means  there arent any script tags include js files
      into our application nodejs uses modules to share your javascript with other javascript in your apps no window 
      or global needed

    + what is module :
        - a module is a reuseable chunk of code that has its own context that way modules cant interfere with or polute
          the global scope
        
    + Two modules types :
        - bydefault node js uses common js modules with newer version of nodejs we can now take advantage of Es6 modules
          to opt into using this syntax you can use the .mjs extension insted of .js

    + Modules syntax:

            const action = ()->{
                code here
            }
            module.exports = action;
            or 
            module.exports = { action } //this common js synatx 

            export const action = ()=>{} //Es6 synatx

        - To use Es6 Syntax add "type": "module" to D:\package.json or use .mjs 

        - module.exports = action; ---> default export
          module.exports = { action } ---> named export

        - import action from './index.js' --> default import
          import { action } from './index.js' --> named import

    + Internal Modules :

        fs - useful for interacting with file system
        path - lib to assist with manipulating file path
        child_process - spawn subprocesses in the background
        http - interact with os level networking. useful for creating servers.
