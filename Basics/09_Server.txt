Creating a Low Level Server :
    - Node js has Functionality to OS level Functionality, like networking tools. this allows us to build very capable servers
    - Node js is single threaded and runs and event loop for asyn task.
    - Node js is widely used for the APIs that need to respond fast and dont require heavy cpu intensive work

    + The hard way :
        - Node js ships with http module. This module is abstraction  around OS level networking tools
        - import http from 'http'


    + EX : Creating Server

        import http from 'http'

        const host = 'localhost'
        const port = 8000

        const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
            if(req.method === 'POST'){
                let body = ''
                req.on('data', chunk=>{
                    body+=chunk
                })
                req.on('close',()=>{
                    console.log(body)
                })

                //now it is important to close connection by respond to request else
                //server will go in handing state

                res.writeHeader(201)
                res.end('OK')
            }
            else{
                res.writeHead(200)
                res.end('HI')
            }
        })

        server.listen(port,host,()=>{
            console.log(`Server is Running on ${localhost} & port = ${PORT})
        })
