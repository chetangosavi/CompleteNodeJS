File System:

    Untile node js there wasnt a great way to access the file system on a matchine with javascript this is due to
    secutrity restrictions in most browsers. with nodejs one can create,edit, remote, read,stream & more with files

    + Reading File:
        - Node js ships with a powerful module fs short for file system there are many methods on fs module
        - to read file we will use readFile() method

    + importing fs :

        import { fs } from 'fs'
